The data set for this comes from the UC Irvine Machine Learning data repository, which hosts a large collection of data sets for use with machine learning algorithms. The original data set for this exercise is available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication#.

The original data set was prepared by taking pictures of both real and fake bank notes and then compressing those images via a wavelet transform. The researchers who prepared the data set then extracted four key features from each compressed input image, and then classified each instance as either a real note or a forged note.

In this program, we try to construct a model that can separate the two classes.
